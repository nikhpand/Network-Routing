Network-Routing
===============

This repository has the code for doing an analysis on the performance of below algorithms
for finding Maximum Capacity Path(MCP) for a given weighted graph.
This analysis is useful for finding the best paths in a network for routing.

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm without using a heap to store fringe nodes
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm with using a heap to store fringe nodes
3. Kruskal's Algorithm for finding Maximum Spanning Tree    
   The path in a Maximum Spanning Tree between any two nodes is MCP
   
Run MaxCapacityPathAnalysis.sh to compile and run the code on linux based systems.
Alternatively, manually compile and run the JAVA files.
